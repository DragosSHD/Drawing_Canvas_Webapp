## About


This project was created by following [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjULmG8fqc8)  about Node.js, WebSockets and P5.js. 
In addition to what was presented in the tutorial, I have added the possibility of changing the brush color and arranged everything in a simple FE using flex.
